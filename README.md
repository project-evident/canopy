# Analysis of the Canopy data for Clay Christensen Institute



### How are K-12 schools innovating across the country?

The Canopy project allows education leaders, school designers, and researchers to see both the “trees”—individual schools—and the whole “forest” of schools that are innovating. Nominating organizations from across the country identified schools to be included in the Canopy. Many of those schools confirmed their data, providing a picture of emerging innovative practices across a diverse set of schools.


You can read more about the data in the repository at the [Clay Christensen Institute](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/publications/canopy/) or at the [interactive project page](https://canopyschools.transcendeducation.org/), created in partnership with Transcend Education.

### This repository

In this repository we are sharing the R code used to perform our internal analyses of the Canopy data, and to create many of the visualizations included in the Clay Christensen Institute's series of blog posts about insights gleaned from the data set. You can read more on the [Clay Christen Institute's website](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/results/?_sf_s=canopy).

Feel free to use this data and code for your own exploration!
